My name is Wyatt Rush, I am a graduate student at George Mason University persuing a M.S. in Mathematics. My primary focus of study has been in operations research, numerical analysis, and data science. I also have a background in interdisciplinary research. Some of the topics I have worked on are speed of spread over networks, plant hydraulics and climate modeling, and predictive models for COPD.
